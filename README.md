# ADC Chaining
 The main objective of this project is to create an embedded system that performs ADC chaining to read and process data from LM35 temperature sensor, LDR, and a potentiometer. The system will convert analog signals from these sensors into digital values, allowing users to monitor temperature, light intensity, and voltage level.
